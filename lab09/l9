Lab 9 - Debugging and Testing

1) After compling and running bug3, it returned "Segmentation fault (core dumped). There is also a new file called bug3 which is executable and it modified a file called core.

2) The functions that bombed:
#1  0x00000000004009ad in inTable ()
#2  0x0000000000400920 in main ()

3)
	c. Segmentation fault (core dumped)
		Fix:
		/* Increment numlines after pointer is returned */
		st[ numLines ] = strdup( buff );
		++numLines;
	e. Segmentation fault (core dumped)
		This error is caused by illegal memory location use. You can fix this by editing your code to not use illegal memory locations. 
	f. undefined reference to 'main'
	   Fixed by inlcuding brackets for the for statement

4) The compiler only catces syntax errors, not user input errors. The stack outputs that the same value is repeated.

5) Using qsort and passing strings through the function will cause an error because qsort can't differeniate between strings or intergers.
