Lab 5 - Programming Style

----- Programming Style -----

1.1) The comments don't add any value to the code since we know 0 is false and 1 is true. I don't know what "ch" as a variable really means in this code. Everything else is fine

1.2) 
int smaller(char *first, char *second) {
	if (strcmp(first, second) < 1)
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;
	}

1.3) I read it out loud

1.4)
if ( c != 'y' || c != 'Y')
	return;

if (length > BUFSIZE)
	length = BUFSIZE;

flag = !flag

if (*line == '"')
	quote = 1;
else
	quote = 0;

bit = (val & 1) ? 1 : 0;

1.5) The function "read" is an unclear variable. The *ip is unclear to the function. 

1.6) 2 3

1.7)
if (!istty(stdin) && !isitty(stdout) && !isitty(stderr))
	return 0;

if (retval != SUCCESS)
return retval

for (k=0; k<4; k++) {
	scanf("%lf", &dx);
	x += dx;
}

1.8)
for (int count=0; count<total; count++) {
	if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
		return (true);
	}
}

1.9)
The varibale 'c' needs parentheses

1.10)
#define METER_PER_FEET 0.3048
#define FEET_PER_METER 3.2084
#define FEET_PER_MILE 5280.0
#define KILOMETER_PER_MILE 1.609344
#define SQ_KILOMETER_PER_SQ_MILE 2.589988

1.11)
First comment should say it returns no value
Second comment doesn't explain what MAX does
Third comment doesn't explain what the message is about
Forth comment is fine
Fifth comment is the same as the forth comment
Sixth comment is the same as the fifth comment
