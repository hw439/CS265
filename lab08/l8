Lab 8: Interfaces and Makefiles

1)
	i) Program Implementation is hidden from the user so the system can be changed without affecting the user
	ii) These are non-overlapping functions that do one thing
	iii) An interface does what it's supposed to do. The user shouldn't be suprised
	iv) Programs should be consistent in their implementation with similar interfaces

2) There are empty fields, commas within quotes, and escaped quotes

3) Commas within quotes and quotes within quotes are handled better

4) Empty fields are not handled properly. You also can't parse two files at the same time

5) The C++ implemnetation does not solve the issues and empty fields still aren't handled properly

6) Yes, the C++ implementation adheres to good i/f.
